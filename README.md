# Fire and Motion Detection System

## Overview
This project is a Fire and Motion Detection system using computer vision and sensor-based technology. It is designed to detect fire and motion in real-time and alert users through notifications or alarms. The system can be used for safety applications in homes, offices, and industrial settings.

## Features
- **Real-time Fire Detection**: Uses image processing techniques to detect fire in video feeds.
- **Motion Detection**: Identifies movement using computer vision algorithms.
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications or triggers alarms when fire or motion is detected.
- **Camera Integration**: Supports webcam or external camera input for real-time monitoring.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Stores detected events for future reference and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional for AI-based fire detection)
  - Twilio/SMTP (for notifications)
- **Hardware (Optional)**:
  - Camera Module

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fire-Motion-Detection.git
   cd Fire-Motion-Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Configuration
- Update the `config.py` file to set notification preferences (email, SMS, etc.).
- Modify threshold values for fire and motion detection as per your environment.

## Usage
1. Ensure the camera is connected and properly positioned.
2. Run `main.py` to start real-time monitoring.
3. When fire or motion is detected, the system will trigger alerts.
4. Logs will be saved in the `logs/` directory for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- AI-powered fire detection using deep learning.
- Cloud integration for remote monitoring.
- Mobile app support for real-time alerts.
- Integration with IoT devices.

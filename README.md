# Fire and Motion Detection System

## Overview
This project is a Fire and Motion Detection system using computer vision and sensor-based technology. It is designed to detect fire and motion in real-time and alert users through notifications or alarms. The system can be used for safety applications in homes, offices, and industrial settings.

## Features
- **Real-time Fire Detection**: Uses image processing techniques to detect fire in video feeds.
- **Motion Detection**: Identifies movement using computer vision algorithms.
- **Alert System**: Sends notifications or triggers alarms when fire or motion is detected.
- **Camera Integration**: Supports webcam or external camera input for real-time monitoring.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Stores detected events for future reference and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional for AI-based fire detection)
  - Twilio/SMTP (for notifications)
- **Hardware (Optional)**:
  - Camera Module
